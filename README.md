# About

This repo contains both `langcraft`, a framework built in Python for autogenerating Minecraft datapack components in a readable, maintainable way; and, `mal` (MetaAutoLang), a fully-featured language with parser and interpreter for building code autogeneration as a meta-language.  

Core features of `langcraft` include control flow, automatic optimization, and handling of entities with context wrappers. For example, `langcraft` includes a builin `ScoreTree` structure which enables switching to arbitrary functions based on a scoreboard value in log(n) time using a tree, and abstractions for basic control flow such as `If`, `While`, and functions that enable far more concise and readable syntax. The source code is available in `src/langcraft`. 

# Setup

To use langcraft, either simply include the `langcraft` directory in your source code or `pip install` it, and then use `from langcraft import *` to import all the basic builtins. To run tests and build autogenerated code, run `python -m langcraft`.
